## Twisted bilayer graphene (UC Santa Barbara)
I am an experimental condensed matter physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I received the B.Eng., M.Eng. and Ph.D. in Applied Physics from the University of Tokyo under the supervision of Prof. Yoshihiro Iwasa. After a short-period postdoc in Molecular Informatics team at RIKEN AIP, I joined Andrea Young’s group at the University of California, Santa Barbara in October 2018 as an [Elings Prize Fellow](https://www.cnsi.ucsb.edu/resources/funding/elings-prize/fellows). My current research focuses on quantum phenomena in 2D materials and van der Waals moire heterostructures.
