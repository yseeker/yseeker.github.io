Isospin Pomeranchuk effect in twisted bilayer graphene
Y. Saito*, F. Wang*, J. Ge, X. Liu, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, J.I.A. Li, E. Berg, A. F. Young
Nature 592, 220-224 (2021).

In condensed matter systems, higher temperature typically disfavors ordered phases leading to an upper critical temperature for magnetism, superconductivity, and other phenomena. A notable exception is the Pomeranchuk effect in 3He, in which the liquid ground state freezes upon increasing the temperature due to the large entropy of the paramagnetic solid phase. Here we show that a similar mechanism describes the finite temperature dynamics of spin- and valley- isospins in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Most strikingly a resistivity peak appears at high temperatures near superlattice filling factor nu=-1, despite no signs of a commensurate correlated phase appearing in the low-temperature limit, suggestive of a Pomeranchuk-type mechanism. The entropy of disordered isospin moments in the ferromagnetic phase stabilizes it relative to an isospin unpolarized Fermi liquid phase at elevated temperatures.

Hofstadter subband ferromagnetism and symmetry broken Chern insulators in twisted bilayer graphene
Y. Saito, J. Ge, L. Rademaker, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, D. A. Abanin, A. F. Young
Nature Physics 17, 478-481 (2021).

we show that twisted bilayer graphene in a finite magnetic field hosts a cascade of ferromagnetic Chern insulators with Chern number ∣C∣ = 1, 2 and 3. The emergence of the Chern insulators is driven by the interplay of the moiré superlattice with the magnetic field, which endows the flat bands with a substructure of topologically non-trivial subbands characteristic of the Hofstadter butterfly. The new phases can be accounted for in a Stoner picture; in contrast to conventional quantum Hall ferromagnets, electrons polarize into between one and four copies of a single Hofstadter subband. Distinct from other moiré heterostructures, Coulomb interactions dominate in twisted bilayer graphene, as manifested by the appearance of Chern insulating states with spontaneously broken superlattice symmetry at half filling of a C = −2 subband.

 

 

Independent superconductors and correlated insulators in twisted bilayer graphene
Y. Saito, J. Ge, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, A. F. Young
Nature Physics 16, 926-930 (2020).

We show that superconductivity can appear far away from the correlated insulating states. Although both superconductivity and correlated insulating behavior are strongest near the flat-band condition, superconductivity survives to larger detuning of the angle. Our observations are consistent with a ‘competing phases’ picture in which insulators and superconductivity arise from different mechanisms.

Quantum phase transitions in highly crystalline two-dimensional superconductors
Y. Saito, T. Nojima and Y. Iwasa
Nature Communications 9, 778 (2018).

According to the magneto-transport studies in 2D superconducting ZrNCl and MoS2, we found that the quantum metallic state commonly observed at low magnetic fields is converted via the quantum Griffiths state to the weakly localized metal at high magnetic fields. The scaling behavior, characterized by the diverging dynamical critical exponent (Griffiths singularity), indicates that the quantum fluctuation manifests itself as superconducting puddles. The present results suggest that evolution from the quantum metallic to the quantum Griffiths state is generic nature in highly crystalline 2D superconductors with weak pinning potentials.

Superconductivity protected by spin-valley locking in ion-gated MoS2
Y. Saito, Y. Nakamura, M. S. Bahramy, Y. Kohama, J. T. Ye, Y. Kasahara, Y. Nakagawa, M. Onga, M. Tokunaga, T. Nojima, Y. Yanase and Y. Iwasa
Nature Physics 12, 144-149 (2016).   (arXiv:1506.04146)
By performing pulsed high-magnetic-field measurements up to 55 Tesla, we found that the gate-induced superconductivity in MoS2 single crystals exhibits an anomalously large upper critical field of approximately 52 T, which indicates an enhancement of the Pauli limit by a factor of four compared to the conventional one. Combined with first-principles calculation and associated realistic tight-binding calculations based numerical estimation of the upper critical field, we reveal that this unusual behavior is due to an inter-valley Cooper pairing that is protected by spin-valley locking originating from inplane mirror symmetry breaking in MoS2 single layer and strong spin-orbit coupling (Ising superconductivity).

Metallic ground state in an ion-gated two-dimensional superconductor
Y. Saito, Y. Kasahara, J. T. Ye, Y. Iwasa and T. Nojima
Science 350, 409ー413 (2015).   (arXiv:1511.03266)

We found that an ion-gated ZrNCl single crystal, exhibiting a dome-shaped phase diagram (Tc vs carrier density), becomes a truly 2D crystalline superconductor with the effective superconducting thickness of 1.8 nanometers, which is thinner than one-unit-cell. In particular, we discovered that the zero resistance state is immediately destroyed by the application of out-of-plane magnetic fields, and consequently, a quantum metallic state is stabilized in a wide range of magnetic fields. We concluded that this quantum metallic is caused by the quantum tunneling of vortices due to the extremely weak pinning and disorder.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
