I am a software engineer with broad experience ranging from experimental research of quantum physics and materials science to machine learning product development/management.

I earned Ph.D. in the field of Applied Physics at the University of Tokyo, focusing on the experimental study of electrical transport and superconductivity in 2D materials. After Ph.D., through a short-period postdoc at the molecular informatics team at RIKEN AIP, I joined Andrea Young's group at the University of California, Santa Barbara as an [Elings Prize Fellow](https://www.cnsi.ucsb.edu/programs/elings-fellowships), where I was working on strongly corrrelated phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene. After the postdoc, I joined DATAGRID and am mainly working on development of products based on deep learning, especially deep generative models, focusing on virtual humans, virtual-try-on ([kitemiru](https://kitemiru.tech/)) and chemoinformatics/drug discovery.
