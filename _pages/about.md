I am a software engineer with broad experience from basic research of quantum physics and materials science to machine learning product development.

I earned Ph.D. in the field of Applied Physics at the University of Tokyo, focusing on the experimental study of low-temperature physics (e.g. superconductivity) in 2D materials ([Science 2015](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6259/409), [Nature Physics 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3580)). After Ph.D., through a short-period postdoc at the molecular informatics team at RIKEN AIP, I joined Andrea Young's group at the University of California, Santa Barbara as an [Elings Prize Fellow](https://www.cnsi.ucsb.edu/programs/elings-fellowships), where I was working on quantum phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene ([Nature Physics 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0928-3), [Nature Physics 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-01129-4), [Nature 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03409-2)). After the postdoc, I joined DATAGRID and am mainly working on development of applications/products based on deep generative models focusing on virtual humans, virtual-try-on and chemoinformatics.
