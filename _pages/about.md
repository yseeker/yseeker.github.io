I am an experinced software engineer with a diverse background, ranging from academic research in quantum physics and materials science to the development and management of cutting-edge generative AI products within the industry.

During Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo, I focused on the experimental study of low-temperature physics, specifically superconductivity in ionic-liquid gated 2D materials. After completing my doctorate, I joined RIKEN AIP's molecular informatics team for a brief postdoctoral period. I later joined Prof. [Andrea Young's group](https://www.afylab.com/) as an [Elings Prize Fellow](https://www.cnsi.ucsb.edu/programs/elings-fellowships) at University of California Santa Barbara, where I studied quantum transport properties in twisted bilayer graphene.

Currently, as a Lead Engineer at DATAGRID, I play a crucial role in the development and multiple-team management of various generative AI-based products, such as visual inspection AI, virtual try-on, and drug discovery/chemoinformatics. My diverse background in both natural science and software engineering allows me to effectively navigate the challenges and opportunities in these interdisciplinary fields.
